## Key Concepts

**Boxes** are the fundamental building blocks when HTML is passed to our CSS. **Block Level** elements refer to elements that will be displayed as a new "block" by CSS.  **In-line** elements, on the other hand, are displayed in-line with the text of the web page.

Block elements can sit inside one another.  The outer, or parent, element is said to "contain" the inner block.  If a styling is applied to the outer element, it will also apply to it's contained elements.  This styling can be overridden however, with CSS specificity using class, ID's, or other CSS techniques.

**Positioning** can be changed using CSS as well.  When we talk about **normal flow** of the page, we are reffering to how the page would be displayed "normally" without CSS manipulation. **Absolute** positioning takes elements out of normal flow and positions them in relation to their containing element. **Floating** can be used to have text or content wrap around a certain element.  An example would be to float a photo left or right so that the text of the page can wrap around the photo and be read in a logical manner.
