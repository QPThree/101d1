## Problem Domain

The articles autho, John Sonmez, says that the answer to many peoples question of "What is the hardest part of programming?" is learning the problem domain.  

He compares the progamming to putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  A jigsaw puzzle where you can't entirely picture the end result is difficult, it's abstract.  Writing a big enough program is similar.  Sometimes we know major components and this makes it easier to build and work from reference of what we have.  Sometimes, especially in the "real world", we are not given the full picture of what our end goal looks like.  This create an abstract problem domain, much like our difficult jigsaw puzzle, that be can be very difficult to navigate!
