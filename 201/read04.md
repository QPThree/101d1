## Links

Links in HTML are inserted using the **< a >** element.  Between your opening and closing < a > tags, you can write anything you'd like.  This text will appear on your rendered webpage and will be what is "clicked" for your link.  Inside your opening < a > tag is where you will put the **href** attribute.  The value of href will be the address of the site or page you are linking!

Links can be used in lists, your navigation bar, or right in-line of your text.  

When linking to a page on the same site, you do not need to include the full URL in the href.  Instead, you can use the relative URL.  Depending on how your files are organized, this may look different.  For example, if all of your files are in the same folder, then your relative URL will simply be the name of the file/page you are linking to.  If moving to parent or child folders, your relative URL must include that information.  Moving to parent or grandparent folders is done with two periods followed by a forward slash.  Moving in the other direction to child folders is done by simply naming the folder and following it with a forward slash.  

## Layouts

HTML layout using CSS is useful for creating professional, appropriately organized web pages.
