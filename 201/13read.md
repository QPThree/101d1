## Brief History

Web Apps have had a weak point regarding storage.  Back in the day, when cookies were the only way to store data, it really wasn't an option due to the downsides of cookies and using them for user data.

Microsoft introduced *DHTML Behaviors* which contained *userData*. userData allowed for up to 64KB of data to be stored per domain.

In 2007, Google's Gears allowed unlimited amounts of data to be stored per domain via an embedded SQL Database.

Unfortunately, each way of storing user data on webapps was different, with different allotments, on different browsers.
