## Object Oriented Programming

**Domain Modeling** is essentially creating a model of a real world problem in our code.  In code, this practice is commonly known as *object oriented programming*.  We use objects in code to store and contain values (properties and methods).  These objects can then be used in our models to represent the "real world", or otherwise conceptual, models.

Objects can be created using *constructore functions*.  These functions can have properties and methods "attached" to them. When an object is made using the constructor, arguments are passed which specify that specific objects values for it's respective properties.
