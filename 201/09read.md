## Forms

**Forms** serve many purposes on our web page.  A form can be uesed to search for something that the user specifies, are they can be used to register a personal email to get notifications, or when you might create an account to become a validated member of a particular service.

Forms can include single line text entries, multi-line text entries, drop-down choices, radio button choices, or form submission buttons, among others.

### Form Flow

1. User selects or inputs data

2. Name of form control and values are sent to server upon user submission

3. The server processes the information

4. A new webpage or element is sent in return to be displayed to the user. 

The data is sent to the server usign name/value pairs.

### Form Structure

Form controls live inside of a form element. Action attributes are attached to each form element that hold a URL for the page on the server that receives the user inputted data upon submission.
