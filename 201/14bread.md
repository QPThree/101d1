# Google and Teams

The modern workplace calls for a ballooning amount of teamwork and collaboration. Upwards of 75% of an employees day is spent talking or collaborating with their teammates!

Studies have shown that groups tend to be more efficient when coming up with ideas, and better and noticing problems or issues. Google set out to find the "perfect team" and spent millions of dollars in doing so. 

While findings were difficult to make much of at first, a few things emerged.  It seems that when a group shares the time they each speak, and that when members feel safe in speaking and suggesting ideas, that the group tends to do well. Psychological-safety is a term they used which includes "conversational turn-taking" and "empathy". Essentially, teams do well when everyone gets a chance to talk!

People want to carry their personalities with them.  It's part of who they are. Allowing conversation and those personalities to show can work great in a common-goal, team setting.
