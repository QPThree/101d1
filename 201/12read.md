## Chart.js

Chart.js is a plugin that allows us to display data in charts on our web pages.  Charts are an incredibly effective, stylish way to display data.

Chart.js is first downloaded and unzipped.  A copy is then made in the directory of our project, and imported into our HTML file via a script tag.

A canvas element is then used in our HTML and will be where the chart will be rendered.

Using our chart object, we can pass in data via a script and use a method (e.g. .line()) to render our data.  Our data can be sotred as an object containing labels and arrays of values as our data.

Pie and bar methods can also be called to render our data as the respective kind of chart.
