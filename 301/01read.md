## Component Based Architecture

The objective of Component Architecture is to allow components to be reusable.  Component oriented software reduces development time and cost, and increases reliability of code by using tried and true components. 

### What is a component?

A component is a single unit of functional code and interface. A component for example could be the header of a web page with nav bar and animation. It can be deploayed independantly, or with other components to fill out a full-fleshed application.

### What are the charactistics of a component?

* Reusability - Components are desgined for reuse. 

* Replaceable - Components may be substituted with other components of similar applicability

* Not context specific - Components designed for different contexts and environments

* Extensible - Components can be extended from existing components

* Encapsulated - A component does not expose internal processes or variables or states. 

* Independant - Components are designed to have minimal dependancies

### What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

* Ease of Deployment

* Reduced Cost

* Ease of Development

* Reusable

* Modification of technical complexity

* Reliability

* System Maintenance and Evolution

* Independent
