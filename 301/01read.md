## Component Based Architecture

The objective of Component Architecture is to allow components to be reusable.  Component oriented software reduces development time and cost, and increases reliability of code by using tried and true components. 

### What is a component?

A component is a single unit of functional code and interface. A component for example could be the header of a web page with nav bar and animation. It can be deploayed independantly, or with other components to fill out a full-fleshed application.

### What are the charactistics of a component?

* Reusability - Components are desgined for reuse. 

* Replaceable - Components may be substituted with other components of similar applicability

* Not context specific - Components designed for different contexts and environments

* Extensible - Components can be extended from existing components

* Encapsulated - A component does not expose internal processes or variables or states. 

* Independant - Components are designed to have minimal dependancies

### What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

* Ease of Deployment

* Reduced Cost

* Ease of Development

* Reusable

* Modification of technical complexity

* Reliability

* System Maintenance and Evolution

* Independent

## Props

*Props* are how components within a react application communicate with one another.  They might need to communicate for functionality and feature purposes.

### What is props short for?

*Props* is short for *properties*

### How are props used in React?

To pass a prop, the data first needs to be contained inside an attribute. It can then be passed to on or more child components by using props. Once passed, the data can then be rendered. 

*Props* are arguments passed into React components.

*Props* is a special keyword in React.

### What is the flow of props?

Props flow in a uni-directional way.  Meaning from parent-to-child component.
