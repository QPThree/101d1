## React Lifecycle

1. The 'Render' happens first

2. The constructor is called before the component is mounted.

3. Constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, componentWillUnmount

4. *componentDidMount* is a method invoked right after a comoponent is mounted. It can be used to make any calls to functions you want to run once the component is in place (e.g. setting state or network requests)
