## React Lifecycle

1. The 'Render' happens first

2. The constructor is called before the component is mounted.

3. Constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, componentWillUnmount

4. *componentDidMount* is a method invoked right after a comoponent is mounted. It can be used to make any calls to functions you want to run once the component is in place (e.g. setting state or network requests)

## React State vs. Props

1. Props are meant for static information. Things like *title*, *description*, or *src* values. 

2. Props are static, where as state is meant to be fluid and change.

3. We re-render our application anytime a prop or state is changed.

4. State can be used to store dynamic values.  Examples might be a counter, a score, or a position.
