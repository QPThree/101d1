## Functional Programming

1. What is functional programming?

> "Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data" - Wikipedia

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

We know a function is pure if it satisfies to questions: Does it return the same result if given the same arguments? Does it *not* cause any observable side-effects?

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

Testing is easier.

4. What is immutability?

Something is immutable if it's cannot be changed. Immutability if it's state cannot be changed after they've been created. 

5. What is Referential transparency?

When a function consistently returns the same result with like arguments. It is the result of using pure functions and immutable data.
