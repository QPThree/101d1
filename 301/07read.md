## Getting Some REST

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

  Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers and researched why the web works how it does!

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

The systems weren't designed to talk like that. They were designed to communicate with small groups of machines, not *all* of the machines.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

The protocol applies verbs to nouns.  Our URL that we type is the "noun" and a verb (GET, POST, etc.) is performed on it.

4. What does a GET do?

GET retrieves the informatino asked for. 

5. What does a POST do?

POST *adds* information to another system.

6. What does PUT do?

PUT *replaces* data in a system.

7. What does PATCH do?

PATCH partially updates data in a system.
