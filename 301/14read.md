## When women stopped coding

1. What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

  Computer's started showing up in homes. i.e. they were being marketed and sold, and primarily to men.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

  They had experience. They were now showing up to freshman year in college with a higher level of computer knowledge than an individual who had not grown up using computer's.

## Diversity in tech companies

1. What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

  * Women are drastically under-represented in tech as a percentage compared to the population

  * Certain ethnicities, specifically latino and black, seem to also be underrepresented. They do seem to be trending in the right direction, however.

  * Congress and Fortune 500 companies are honestly embarressing and shameful in regards to diversity.

## Why diversity matters to your tech team

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

When the efforts are spearheaded by company leaders.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

They bring diverse perspectives to a problem, which means a diverse range of solutions, which relates to quicker and more efficient problem solving.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

I loved the example of youtube's development team being right handed. As a result, a significant amount of videos uploaded to their app were upside down. (Left handed people take a landscape video with the opposite phone orientation of a right handed person). A great example of how a more diverse company could better fit the needs and wants of it's diverse user-base.
