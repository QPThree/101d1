## Text in HTML

Tags, known as *markup*, are used to display text on your created webpage.  Tags to display text include the **paragraph** tags, **heading** tags, **bold** tags, and *italic* tags.

Different text tags give *life* and *structure* to your webpage!  Use them creatively and they can be simple way to spruce up your text.  

### Semantic Markup

Certain text elements are used without the intention of affeting the overall structure of the webpage.  Their purpose, in addition to displaying text on the rendered page, is to add additional information to the page.  This information can then be used by screen reading or search engine programs.  

Examples of semantic markup include the **blockquote** tag, the **cite** tag, or an **address** tag.
