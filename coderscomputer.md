# The Coder's Computer

The computer is to the software developer what the kitchen is to the cook.  The michelin cook requires sharp knives, clean workspaces, and trusted recipes.  A preferred text editor and the terminal program are two essential tools in the developers kitchen. We will discuss both and what they bring to the table in the paragraphs below!

## I Choose You, Text Editor

### The 'what' of the Editors

Text editors are software that help you, the developer, write, well, more software.  Advantages of text editors include:

* code completion
* syntax highlighting
* color themes 
* installable extensions

Think of these additions as luxuries, not essentials.  Anyone can program with these features, like a car can run fine without power windows and locks. But most of the time, they're just nice to *have*.

### The 'which' of the Editors

Some basic text editors come pre-installed on your operating system.  These options include text-edit on mac or notepad on windows.  Popular third party options include Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text.  Whichever editor you decide to choose you will likely find things you like about it.  Just know it's the chef that makes the meal well, not what kitchen they're cooking in.




## Taking Leave with Terminal


### The 'what' of Terminal

A terminal is essential a command line interface to interact with your computer.  Instead of clicking and moving things graphically and visually, you interact and give 'commands' view text.

### ShortCuts

While daunting at first, terminal is full of short-cuts which can be used to save you precious time and googing-energy. Some common shortcuts include:

* Up/Down Arrow key
>Used to traverse previous command entries

* pwd
>Print Working Directory i.e. shows you the current directory (folder) that you are in

* ls
>Short list gives the user a list of what files and folders are located in the current directory

* ~
>Shortcut for the 'Home' directory

* .
>Refers to the current directory (Note: *single* dot)

* ..
>Refers to the parent directory (Note: *two* dots)

* cd
> used to change directory.  Will be immediately followed by directory in which you'd like to move to

### Closing Concepts

A few reminders when using terminal and the command line:

1. Everything is treated as a file under linux.  Your folder, application, and directory will all be handled as 'files'.
2. Linux is case sensitive.  Everything will be read as carefully as your password.  Treat your commands with the same attention to detail.
3. Linux is extentionless.  Meaning files can have any extension they want, or none at all.  Linux will deal with them adequately regardless.
