## Git Out of Here!

Aircraft pilots have utilize black boxes.  These boxes log every single maneuver and input the pilots do.  Data on the black box can store all of these inputs and be viewed at future dates (e.g. there may be a mishap that requires investigation into the flight).

Git is the black box for programmers!  Only, if a programmer crashes and burns, the beauty of Git is they can load to a previous state (or snapshot) or their program and start again!  

Git saves snapshots and previous states of every single action.  Project teammates may see what lines of code were added or taken away, what functions were changed and how, or even leave comments for one another!


## Local Git <--> Cloud Git

Git works by having a main repository, or location, for your program.  This is then cloned to a local storage.  Once the clone is on the local storage, changes can be made that do not affect the main repository until the editor is ready.  Once the editor(s) is ready, they must remember and follow the workflow!
