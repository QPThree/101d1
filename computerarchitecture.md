### Computer's 101

## What Makes This Machine a Computer?

Computers are a tool to help us solve problems.  Much like a hammer is a tool to help us build physical items.  Or a shovel is a tool to help us dig a hole.  Computers just help us solve problems that these other tools can't.

Four components are common to all computers.

1. Input - The abillity to receive input or data
2. Storage - The ability to store and access the data
3. Processing - The ability to manipulate the data
4. Output - The ability to return a new output of data after processing.  

The real power of computer comes when you string these processes together.  A string of dozens or hundreds of outputs which become another programs input.  

## Binary Number System

Unlike our often used 'decimal' system, which has digits from 0 to 9, the binary system has only two digits: 0 and 1.  In the decimal system, each position is a multiple of 10 from the lower position.  For example, the 1's 10's and 100's position.  10 is 10 x 1, 100 is 10 x 10, and so on. 

In the binary positions, each position is a multiple of two. 1's, 2's, 4's, and 8's.

In a computer, these 1's and 0's represent 'on' and 'off'.  With enough wires indicating either a '1' or a '0', we can store and work with large amount of data.  Remember, data is just represented by a series of 1's and 0's!

Each wire is a single *bit* of data.  Fortunatlely for those of us wrapping our head around this, we don't have to deal directly with the 0's and 1's.  We deal with an interface of images and words, which get converted to the lower level binary that the computer interprets.
