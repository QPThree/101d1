## What Makes This Machine a Computer?

Computers are a tool to help us solve problems.  Much like a hammer is a tool to help us build physical items.  Or a shovel is a tool to help us dig a hole.  Computers just help us solve problems that these other tools can't.

Four components are common to all computers.

1. Input - The abillity to receive input or data
2. Storage - The ability to store and access the data
3. Processing - The ability to manipulate the data
4. Output - The ability to return a new output of data after processing.  

The real power of computer comes when you string these processes together.  A string of dozens or hundreds of outputs which become another programs input.

## Binary Number System

Unlike our often used 'decimal' system, which has digits from 0 to 9, the binary system has only two digits: 0 and 1.  In the decimal system, each position is a multiple of 10 from the lower position.  For example, the 1's 10's and 100's position.  10 is 10 x 1, 100 is 10 x 10, and so on. 

In the binary positions, each position is a multiple of two. 1's, 2's, 4's, and 8's.

In a computer, these 1's and 0's represent 'on' and 'off'.  With enough wires indicating either a '1' or a '0', we can store and work with large amount of data.  Remember, data is just represented by a series of 1's and 0's!

Each wire is a single *bit* of data.  Fortunatlely for those of us wrapping our head around this, we don't have to deal directly with the 0's and 1's.  We deal with an interface of images and words, which get converted to the lower level binary that the computer interprets.

## Circuits and Logic

Circuits take in bit or bits of data, and return bit or bits of data!  The perform what we call 'logic' to determine their output.  Lets look at an example.

Circuit A will take in two bits of data.  Remember, a 0 or 1 is a bit of data.  In this instance, circuit A will return a bit of data depending on the bits that it receives.  If *either* bit is a '1', then the circuit will ouput a '1'.  This is an 'or' circuit.  Similarly, we have 'and' circuits which will only return a '1' if *both* bits coming into it are 1's.  If either bit were a 0, it would return a '0'.  In our circuit A example, both bits would have to be 0's for the circuit to return a '0'.

Strung together, these circuits and logic allow us to create some very powerful programs!

## Hardware and Software

Hardware and software work symbiotically in our computers.  Entire careers are dedicated to studying and working with just hardware, or just software.  We will give a brief overview here of each.  

### Hardware

Hardware includes components you can touch and feel. Examples include:

* Chips
* Circuits
* Keyboards
* Speakers
* Wires

### Software

What you don't see is the software.  Your programs, operating systems, text editors, and the like, are all forms of software.  Without hardware, we wouldn't have anything to *run* the software.  And without software, hardware wouldn't serve much of a purpose! It would have nothing *to* run.
