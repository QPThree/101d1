## Structure

Your house has *structure*.  The car you drive has *structure*.  You research papers in high school, **this class**, all have *structure*.  A website page is no different.  The pages you visit all have structure.  HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the tool we use to give web pages their structure.  We use headings, paragraphs, bold texts, and other techniques to give the foundation to our pages.

As you can see in the code snippet above, even our code has structure.  It's the structure to the structure of the webpage!  Get used to it.  Structure gives us organization, flow, readability, and so much more.
