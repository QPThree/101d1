### Introducing(!): CSS

## CS-Who?

CSS does to a newly built HTML page what painting, flooring, and styling do to a newly built house!

Your web page will gain personality and flair with appropriate CSS.  Consider that the same exact HTML document can look vastly different with different CSS applications!


We will discuss the different components of a CSS document and how they can be utilized to help us development professional grade web pages.

# Selectors

Selectors identify which HTML elements you are manipulating.  In CSS the selector will match whats inside the HTML tag.  For Example:

> p

> h1

> body

With CSS, you can tell the web page to move all 'h1' elements to the left of the page.  Or color the entire body red.  Get creative, let your art style flow!

# Declaration

A declartion looks like the following:

> color: blue;

And will sit inside two curly brackets as such:

> { color: blue;}

You will notice two main components that make up each declaration:

1. Property

2. Value

> selector{property:valule;}

In the example above, 'color' would be the property, and 'blue' would be the value.  


## Inheritance

Humans inherit DNA and genes from their parents.  Similarly, children HTML elements will inherit properties given to their parent elements.

An example would be giving the 'body' element the background color of 'yellow'.

> body {background-color: yellow;}


If there are paragraph elements within the body of the HTML page, they will inherit the backgroun color of yellow, unless otherwise specified!


### CS-Why!?

CSS is often advantageous to be placed in a separate file.  This way, multiple HTML files can be styled with a single CSS stylesheet.  This saves time and makes your project organized and modular. 

Your stylesheet can be linked with the link element in your HTML page.

> < link >

## Closing Thoughts

CSS is a massive area of knowledge and skill.  Don't feel like you need to know every property or value available.  It is a skill you could very well be learning the rest of your career.  

We have only touched the surface of CSS but it is a vital tool to get comfortable with on your journey of web development.
