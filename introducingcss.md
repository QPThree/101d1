### Introducing(!): CSS

## CS-Who?

CSS does to a newly built HTML page what painting, flooring, and styling do to a newly built house!

Your web page will gain personality and flair with appropriate CSS.  Consider that the same exact HTML document can look vastly different with different CSS applications!


We will discuss the different components of a CSS document and how they can be utilized to help us development professional grade web pages.

# Selectors

Selectors identify which HTML elements you are manipulating.  In CSS the selector will match whats inside the HTML tag.  For Example:

> p

> h1

> body

With CSS, you can tell the web page to move all 'h1' elements to the left of the page.  Or color the entire body red.  Get creative, let your art style flow!

# Declaration

A declartion looks like the following:

> color: blue;

And will sit inside two curly brackets as such:

> { color: blue;}

You will notice two main components that make up each declaration:

1. Property

2. Value

> selector{property:valule;}

In the example above, 'color' would be the property, and 'blue' would be the value.  

# Property

# Value

## Inheritance

Why use external style sheets...
